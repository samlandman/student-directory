# Learning Objectives #

I learned how to create a program that runs on the command line.

I learned:
  - How to read and write files in Ruby
  - How to save files in Ruby
  - How to make code more efficient, and learning not to repeat myself.

How I felt:
  - It felt like a Eureka moment when I could write a file to save and load automatically. It felt like a tangible step, and amazing to have achieved so much in such little time.
